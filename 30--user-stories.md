### TodoMVC -- User Stories

#### EPIC: I can create lists of todos so that...
* I can keep track of what I need to do next. 
* I can create lists of my tasks so that I can check them off.
* I can manage my time better.

----

#### I can *mark a task as completed* so that I can track what has been done *track what has been done*.

----

#### I can _mark an incomplete task as completed_ so that I can  _track what has been done_.
* Click a button to mark the task as complete; what does that look like?
* Can I change my mind and mark it as incomplete again?
* Strikethrough on text would be a neat effect...

----

#### I can _add a task to the list_ so that I can  _be reminded of it_.

----

#### I can _view a list of incomplete tasks_ so that I can  _pick what I need to do next_.

----

#### I can _remove completed tasks from the list_ so that I can  _feel good about the tasks I have completed_.

(usually when you get into feelings, instead of the how = ??)   
(The _how_s, things I need to do:)  

* Click a button on each item to remove it; confirm first?
* Can I get it back after I remove it? Trash can vs black hole of death?
* Can I remove more than one item at a time? All completed items?

----

#### I can _change a task on the list_ so that I can  _fix my typos and be more specific about them_.
